<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">THE PRONUNCIATION OF GREEK, &amp;c.</h2>
</div>

<p>It is purely as a practical man, and with a direct practical result
in view, that I venture to put forth a few words on the vexed question
of the <span class="smcap">Pronunciation of Greek</span>. He were a frigid
pedant, indeed, who, with the whole glorious literature of Hellas before
him, and the rich vein of Hellenic Archæology, scarcely yet opened in
Scotland, should, for the mere gratification of a subtle speculative
restlessness, walk direct into this region of philological thorns.
So far as my personal curiosity was concerned, Sir John Cheke, wrapt
in his many folded mantle of Ciceronian verboseness, and the Right
Reverend Stephen Gardiner’s prætorian edicts in favour of Greek
sounds,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
and the βή ϐή of the old comedian’s Attic sheep, might have been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
allowed to sleep undisturbed on the library shelves. I had settled
the question long ago in my own mind on broad grounds of common sense,
rather than on any nice results that seemed obtainable from the
investigations of the learned; but the nature of the public duties now
imposed on me does not allow me to take my own course in such matters,
merely because I think it right. I must shew to the satisfaction of
my fellow-teachers and of my students, that I am not seeking after an
ephemeral notoriety by the public galvanisation of a dead crotchet;
that any innovations which I may propose are in reality, as so often
happens in the political world also, and in the ecclesiastical, a
mere recurrence to the ancient and established practice of centuries,
and that whatever opinions I may entertain on points confessedly open
to debate, I entertain not for myself alone, but in company with
some of the ripest scholars and profoundest philologists of modern
times. I have reason also for thinking with a recent writer, that the
present time is peculiarly favourable for the reconsideration of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
question;<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
for, although Sir John Cheke might have said with some show of truth
in his day, “<i>Græca jam lingua nemini patria est</i>,”<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
none but a prophetic partisan of universal Russian domination in
the Mediterranean will now assert, that the living Greeks are not a
nation and a people who have a right to be heard on the question, how
their own language is to be pronounced. Taking the Greek language as
it appears in the works of the learned commentator Corais, in the
poetry of the Soutzos and Rangabe, in the history of Perrhæbus, so
highly spoken of by Niebuhr, and in the publications of the daily
press at Athens; and taking the new kingdom for no greater thing than
the intrigues of meddling diplomatists, its own wretched cabals, and
the guns of Admiral Parker will allow it to be; it is plain that to
disregard the witness of such a speaking fact, standing as it does upon
the unbroken tradition and catholic philological succession of eighteen
centuries, would be, much more manifestly now than in the days of the
learned <span class="smcap">Wetsten</span>, to “exercise a despotism
over a free language,” such as no man has a right to claim.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
Besides, in Scotland we have already had our orthodox hereditary
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
routine in this matter disturbed by the invasion of English teachers of
the Greek language; an invasion, no doubt, which our strong national
feeling may look on with jealousy, but which we brought on ourselves
by the shameful condition of prostration in which we allowed the
philological classes in our higher schools and colleges to lie for two
centuries; and it was not to be expected that these English teachers,
being placed in a position which enabled them to give the law within
a certain influential circle, should sacrifice their own traditional
pronunciation of the Greek language, however arbitrary, to ours,
in favour of which, in some points, there was little but the mere
conservatism of an equally arbitrary usage to plead. Finding matters
in this condition, I feel it impossible for me to waive the discussion
of a matter already fermenting with all the elements of uncertainty. I
have therefore taken the trouble of working my way through Havercamp’s
two volumes, and comparing the arguments used in the famous old
Cantabrigian controversy with those advanced by a well-informed modern
member of the same learned corporation. I have taken the learned
Germans, too, as in duty bound, on such a question, into my counsels; I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
have devoted not a little time and attention to the language and
literature of modern Greece; and above all, I have carefully examined
those places of the ancient rhetoricians and grammarians that touch
upon the various branches of the subject. With all these precautions,
if I shall not succeed in making converts to my views, I hope, at
least with reasonable men, to escape the imputation of rashness and
superficiality.</p>

<p>The exact history of our present pronunciation of Greek, both in
England and Scotland, I have not learning enough curiously to trace;
but one thing seems to me plain, that all the great scholars in this
country, and on the continent generally, in the fifteenth, and the
early part of the sixteenth century, could have known nothing of our
present arbitrary method of pronouncing;<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
for they could pronounce Greek no other way than as they received it
from Chrysoloras, Gaza, Lascaris, Musurus, and the other native Greeks
who were their masters. Erasmus was, if not absolutely the first,<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
certainly the first scholar of extensive European influence and popularity
who ventured to disturb the tradition of the Byzantine elders in this
matter; but his famous dialogue, <i>De recta Latini Græcique sermonis
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
pronuntiatione</i>, did not appear till the year 1528, by which time
so strong a prescription had already run in favour of the received
method, that it seems strange how even his learning and wit should
have prevailed to overturn it. But there are periods in the history of
the world when the minds of men are naturally disposed to receive all
sorts of novelties; and the era of the Reformation was one of them.
Erasmus, though a conservative in religion, (as many persons are who
are conservative in nothing else,) pleased his free speculative whim
with all sorts of imaginations; and among other things fell—though,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
if what Wetsten tells be true, in a very strange way<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>—on
the notion of purging the pronunciation of the classical languages
of all those defects which belonged to it, whether by degenerate
tradition or perverse provincialism, and erecting in its stead an
ideal pronunciation, made up of erudite conjecture and philosophical
argumentation. Nothing was more easy than to prove that in the course
of two thousand years the orthoepy of the language of the Greeks
had declined considerably from the perfection in which its musical
fulness had rolled like a river of gold from the mouth of Plato, or
had been dashed like a thunderbolt of Jove from the indignant lips
of Demosthenes; yet more easy was it, and admirable game for such a
fine spirit as Erasmus, to evoke the shades of Cicero and Quinctilian,
and make mirth to them out of a Latin oration delivered before the
Emperor Maximilian, by a twittering French courtier and a splay-mouthed
Westphalian baron.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
It is certain also that there are in that dialogue many admirable
observations on the blundering practices of the schoolmasters, and even
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
the learned professors, his contemporaries, which very many of them in
that day, and the great majority even now have wanted either sense or
courage to attend to; observations which, I doubt not, will yet bear
fruit in the present age, if education is to be advanced in the only
way possible, viz., by those whose profession it is to teach others,
learning in the first place to teach themselves. But in one great point
of his rich and various discourse, the learned Dutchman was more witty
than wise, and achieved a success where he was altogether wrong, or
only half-right, that has been denied to him where he is altogether
right. While his admirable observations on accent and quantity, and
many of his precepts on the practical art of teaching languages, have
been totally lost sight of by the great mass of our classical teachers,
his strictures on the pronunciation of the Greek vowels and diphthongs
have been received more or less by pedagogic men in all parts of
Europe; or at least prevailed so far as to shake the faith of scholars
in the pronunciation of the native Greek, and lead them to invent a
new and arbitrary Hellenic utterance for each country, an altogether
barbarous conglomerate, made up of modern national peculiarities and
scraps of Erasmian philology. This is a sorry state of matters; but as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
European scholarship then stood, innovators could look for no more
satisfactory result. Neither Erasmus nor the scholars who followed his
“divisive courses” in England and other countries, were in possession
of philological materials sufficiently comprehensive for settling so
nice a point. Much less could they use the materials in their hands
with that spirit of calm philosophic survey, and that touch of fine
critical sagacity which the ripe scholars of Germany now exhibit.
It was one thing to quarrel learnedly with the pronunciation of
Chrysoloras, and to chuckle with academic pride over the tautophonic
tenuity of σὺ δ’ εἶπέ μοι μὴ μῆκος, and other such ingeniously gathered
scraps of Atticism in the mouth of a modern Turkish serf; another, and
a far more serious thing, to draw out a complete table of elocutionary
sounds, such as they existed at any given period in Greek literature;
say at the successive epochs of Homer, Æschylus, Plato, Callimachus,
Strabo, Chrysostom. Bishop Gardiner, therefore, was right to press this
point hard against the Erasmians,—“<i>Quod vero difficillimum dicebam
neque statuis neque potes, ut tanquam ad punctum constituas sonorum
modum. Ab usu præsente manifeste recedis: sed an ad veterum sonorum
formam omnino accedas, nihil expeditum est.</i>” Here, as in more
serious matters, the good Bishop saw that it was easier to destroy than
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
to build up; and therefore he interposed his interdict despotically
in the Roman style, <i>ne quid detrimenti respublica capiat</i>. But
these maxims of old Roman aristocracy do not apply to the democracy
of letters. So the Bishop’s philological thunderbolt started more
heretics than it laid. The love of liberty was now conjoined with the
love of originality; to speak Greek with Erasmus became now the sign of
academic patriotism and the watchword of philological progress. <span
class="smcap">Force</span> being the chief apparent power on the one
side, it was naturally felt by those against whom it was exercised,
that <span class="allsmcap">REASON</span> was altogether on their side.
The matter was therefore practically settled on the side of persecuted
innovation; the subtlety of a few academic doctors triumphed proudly
over the long tradition of Byzantine centuries, and the living protest
of millions of men, with Greek blood in their veins and Greek words in
their mouths; and they who were once the few despised Nazarenes of the
scholastic world, are now a sort of philological Scribes and Pharisees,
sitting in the seat of Aristarchus, whose dictum it is dangerous to dispute.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Erasmus, Wetsten distinctly asserts, (pp. 15, 115,)
did not himself adopt in his practice the perfect theory of Hellenic
vocalization which he sketched out. So much the less cause is there for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
our having any hesitation in considering the whole question as
now open, and treating it exactly as if Professor John Cheke, and
Professor Thomas Smith of Cambridge University, and Adolphus Mekerchus,
knight and perpetual senator of Bruges, and the other Havercampian
hoplites had never existed. Let us inquire, therefore, in the first
place, whether any certain data exist on which such a matter can be
settled scientifically. We shall give only the grand outlines of
the question, referring the special student to the English work of
<span class="smcap">Pennington</span> already quoted, the German work of
<span class="smcap">Liskov</span>, and the Latin of
<span class="smcap">Seyffarth</span>.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>Now, there are five ways by which the method of pronunciation used
by any gone generation of “articulate-speaking men” may be ascertained,
if not with a curious exactness in every point, at least with such
an amount of approximation as will be esteemed satisfactory by a
reasonable inquirer. <span class="smcap">First</span>, we have the
imitation in articulate letters of natural sounds and of the cries of
animals. There is nothing more certain in the philosophy of language
than that whole classes of words expressive of sound were formed on the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
principle of a direct dramatic imitation of the sound signified. Thus the words
<span class="smcap">dash</span>, <span class="smcap">hash</span>, <span
class="smcap">smash</span>, in our most significant Saxon tongue,
evidently express an action producing sound, in which the strong vowel
sound of <span class="allsmcap">a</span> is combined with a sharp sound
to which the aspirated <span class="allsmcap">s</span> was considered
the nearest approximation by the original framer of the word. So, in
the names expressive of flowing water, the liquids <span class="allsmcap">l</span>
and <span class="allsmcap">r</span> are observed to preponderate in all
languages, these being the sounds which are actually given forth by the
natural objects so signified: thus <i>river</i>, ῤέω, <i>strom</i>,
<i>flumen</i>, <i>purl</i>, the Hebrew <i>nahar</i> and <i>nahal</i>,
&amp;c. And in the same manner, if the bird which we call <span
class="smcap">cuckoo</span> was called by the Latins <i>cuculus</i>,
by the Greeks κόκκυξ, and by the Germans <i>kukuk</i>, no person can
doubt that the vowel sounds at least, in these words, were intended to
be a more or less exact echo of the cry of the bird so designated. In
arguing, however, from such words, care must be taken not to press the
argument too closely; for two things are manifest—that the original
framer of the words might have given, and in all likelihood did give
only a loose, and not a curiously exact imitation of the sound or cry
he meant to express; and then that in the course of centuries the word
may have deviated so far from its original pronunciation, as to be no
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
longer a very striking likeness of the natural sound it is intended to
imitate. These considerations explain the fact how the very simple and
obvious cry made by sheep, which no child will mistake, is expressed
by three very different vowels, in three of the most notable European
languages,—our own <i>bleat</i>, the Latin <i>balare</i>, and the
Greek βληχή, pronounced like <span class="allsmcap">a</span> in <i>mate</i>,
according to the practice of the Greeks in the classical age. From
such words, therefore, no safe conclusion can be drawn as to the
pronunciation of any particular word at any particular period of a
highly advanced civilization. It is different, however, with words
not forming any part of the spoken system of articulate speech, but
invented expressly for the occasion, in order to represent by way of
echo certain natural sounds. In this way, should we find in an old
Athenian spelling-book this sentence, “<i>the sheep cries</i> Βή,”
we should be most justly entitled to conclude, if not that the Greek
<i>B</i> was pronounced exactly like the corresponding letter in our
alphabet, (for the consonants are less easily fixed down in such
imitations of inarticulate cries,) certainly that <i>H</i> had the
sound of our <span class="smcap">ai</span>; and this conclusion would
be irresistible if other arguments were at hand, such as will presently
be mentioned, leading plainly to the same conclusion. Here, however,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
also, care must be taken not to generalize too largely; for, strictly
speaking, the inference from such a fact as the one supposed, is only
that at the particular time and place where the said book was composed,
a particular vowel sounded to the ear of the writer in a particular
way; the proof remaining perfectly open that at some other place during
the same period, or at the same place fifty years later, the same vowel
may have been pronounced in a perfectly different way.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>.
Those who are at all acquainted with the style of reasoning on such
points, exemplified in almost every page of Havercamp’s Collection,
will see the necessity of applying at every step of their progress the
rein of a strictly logical restraint.</p>

<p>Another and a most scientific way by which we may recover the traces
of a lost orthoepy, is from the physiological description of the
action of the organs of speech in producing the sounds belonging to
certain letters, as preserved in the works of grammatical or rhetorical
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
writers. This method of proof, taken by itself, may, no doubt, fail of
giving complete satisfaction in delicate cases; for it is extremely
difficult to give such an exact description of the action of the organs
of speech as will enable a student of an unknown language to reproduce
the sound, without the assistance of the living voice. But, taken
along with other circumstances, the proof from this source may be so
strong as absolutely to force conviction; or at all events imperatively
to exclude certain suppositions, which, without the existence of
such a description, would have been admissible. Now, it happens most
fortunately for our present inquiry, that a very satisfactory scale
of the Greek vowel-sounds is extant in the works of the well-known
historian and critic Dionysius of Halicarnassus, who lived in the time
of Augustus Cæsar. This we shall quote at length immediately; and as
the author was a professional rhetorician, no higher authority on such
a point, for the epoch to which he belongs, can be wished
for.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>Again, a very large and various field of proof lies in those instances
of the direct transference of the sounds of one language into those of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
another, which literary composition sometimes requires, and which are
sure to occur very frequently in an extensive literature like the
Greek. Examples of this are most common in the case of proper names,
and occur especially in translations, as in the ancient translations of
the Hebrew Bible and of the New Testament, which have been admirably
used for the illustration of Greek orthoepy in the work of Seyffarth.
When Strabo, for instance, (p. 213,) in the case given by Pennington,
(p. 73,) says of the inhabitants of the newly colonized town of Como in
Upper Italy,—Νεο κωμῖται ἐκλήθησαν ἅπαντες· τοῦτο δὲ μεθερμηνευθὲν Νο
ϐουμκώμουμ λέγεται, we learn that the diphthong ου was considered by an
intelligent scientific man in the time of Augustus, as being either the
exact equipollent of the Latin <span class="allsmcap">u</span>, or the nearest
approximation to it within the compass of Hellenic vocalization; and when we
are told further that the modern Greeks and the modern Italians pronounce
the same vowels the same way even now, we cannot for a moment doubt
that the method of pronouncing that Greek diphthong now practised in
Scotland (as in <i>boom</i>) is the correct one. From the same passage
we may legitimately draw the inference, with regard to the second
letter in the Greek alphabet, that it was in all probability pronounced
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
softly like our <span class="allsmcap">v</span>; for our <span class="allsmcap">b</span>
is no representative whatever of the Latin <span class="allsmcap">v</span>,
whether we suppose that letter to have been pronounced
like the corresponding letter with us, or like our <span
class="allsmcap">w</span>. The modern Germans, in the same way, who
have not our sound of <span class="allsmcap">w</span>, substitute for
it in their language the sound of <span class="allsmcap">v</span>
regularly, as in <span class="smcap">wasser</span>, which they
pronounce <span class="allsmcap">VASSER</span>, and many such words.
If, therefore, an ancient Greek wished to express the letter <span
class="allsmcap">v</span>, and does so by his own <i>B</i>, the
inference is irresistible, either that his <i>B</i> was pronounced
like our <span class="allsmcap">v</span>, and was viewed as the exact
expression of the Latin letter so pronounced, or as an approximation to
it, if pronounced like our <span class="allsmcap">w</span>; or, on the
other hand, that the Greek organ being utterly incapable of pronouncing
the soft sound of the Latin <span class="allsmcap">v</span>, and
having no letter or combination of letters capable of expressing
it, gave up the attempt in despair, and wrote the soft Latin
<span class="allsmcap">v</span> with a hard Greek <i>B</i>.
But this supposition is improbable, for three reasons: <span
class="smcap">First</span>, because the general character of the Greek
language, as contrasted with the Roman, was not that of blunt hardness
but of liquid softness, (see <span class="smcap">Quinctilian</span>
and <span class="smcap">Cicero</span>, <i>passim</i>;)
<span class="smcap">Secondly</span>, the ancient Greeks, in fact,
had a combination of letters by which they could express in
an approximate way the Latin <span class="allsmcap">v</span>,
namely, ου, and by which they actually did so express it on<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span> many occasions;
<span class="smcap">Thirdly</span>, the modern Greeks likewise do
pronounce the second letter of the alphabet like the Latin
<span class="allsmcap">v</span>; and the burden of proof lies on
those who assert that the ancients pronounced it otherwise.</p>

<p>A fourth method of proof lies in the remarks made on the identical or
cognate sounds of syllables, either incidentally by general writers,
or specially by grammarians in treating orthography and orthoepy; and
in the accidental interchange of letters in inscriptions and coins.
Of the strictly grammatical kind of evidence a very valuable fragment
has been preserved in the Ἐπιμερισμοί of Herodian, the Priscian of the
Greek grammarians, published by Boissonnade in 1817. In this work are
alphabetically arranged large classes of words, which, while they are
pronounced with the same vowel to the ear, are differently spelt to the
eye; as if I should say in English that the vowel-sounds in the words
<span class="smcap">fair</span>, <span class="smcap">fare</span>,
<span class="smcap">heir</span>, <span class="smcap">there</span>, have
the same or a similar orthoepy, but a very different orthography. Of the
other, or incidental kind, may be mentioned those plays of sound with
which epigrammatic writers sometimes amuse themselves, and of which the
echo-poems found in some of the collections of modern Latin, are the
most notable example. Thus, Erasmus, in ridicule of the Ciceronians,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
wrote two lines, of which the first, a hexameter, ends with
<i>Cicerone</i>, the ablative case of the great orator’s Latin name,
while the second line, a pentameter, striking the ear as a sort of
echo of the first, ends with the Greek word ὄνε, <i>O you ass!</i>
from which significant jingle the inference is ready enough, that
the penultimate syllable of both these words, in the classical
pronunciation of Erasmus, was accented, and that the sound of the vowel
in both was the same. The proof, of course, in such a case would have
been equally complete if the word in the second line had been spelt
with a different vowel instead of with the same.</p>

<p><i>Fifthly</i>, In determining the pronunciation of any language at
any past period of its history, its presently existing pronunciation,
though furnishing no absolute proof, is entitled to be taken into
account along with other circumstances, and in the absence of any
distinct evidence to the contrary, must be taken as conclusive. Erasmus
appealed with great success to the vanity of academic men, when he
said, with reference to the common Greek pronunciation in his day,
“<i>Pronuntiationem, quam nunc habent eruditi, non aliunde petunt quam
a vulgo, scis quali magistro</i>;” but to this a learned advocate of
the existing Itacism very wisely replies, that even supposing it were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
true that the vulgar pronunciation of Greek comes to us only from the
<span class="smcap">vulgar</span>, the common people, as is well known, are
generally far more tenacious of hereditary national accent than the upper
classes of society;<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
of which we have a familiar English example in the case of
the stout Yorkshiremen, who have preserved for two thousand years the
deep hollow sound of <i>u</i>, (saying <i>Ool</i>, for <i>Hull</i>,
&amp;c.,) which is the normal sound of that vowel in all the European
languages. In this view it is passing strange to note, that the slender
sound of the first syllable of ἡμέρα, as if written <i>heeméra</i>,
which is the rule with the modern Greeks, is the precise sound, that
in a passage of Plato is noted as the ancient sound, compared with
the fuller sound, <i>haiméra</i>, fashionable in his day;<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
while Aristophanes<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
in one of his plays, introduces a conservative old Spartan lady saying
ἵκει, instead of ἥκει; a distinct proof both that η was not considered
identical with ι in his day, and that it was then sounded as it is now,
by one of the most ancient people in the Pelasgic peninsula.</p>

<p>Such appear to me to be the methods of proof that lie open to an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
inquirer into the orthoepy of any language, living or dead, at any
given period of its history. With these, of course, the student must
combine such general rules on the philosophy of language, and on the
habits of human speech, as a little experience of practical philology
will readily supply. I now proceed to state the results to which I have
arrived, by a thorough study of the existing evidences. After that we
shall make our practical inference, and answer a few natural objections.</p>

<p>In the shape of results, therefore, all that my present purely
practical purpose requires me to lay down, with regard to ancient Greek
vocalization, may be combined in the following two propositions—</p>

<p class="blockquot"><span class="smcap">Proposition I.</span>—It is
demonstrably certain that the method of pronouncing the vowels and
diphthongs generally practised in England and Scotland, especially
in England, since the days of Sir John Cheke,—that is from about the
middle of the sixteenth century—is doubtful in many points, and in
not a few most important points directly opposed to the whole stream
of ancient authority and tradition. It is in fact in a great measure
conjectural, arbitrary, and capricious.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span></p>

<p class="blockquot"><span class="smcap">Proposition II.</span>—It is
equally certain that the modern Greeks have declined in several most
important points from the purity of Hellenic orthoepy, as practised in
the most classic times; but many of the striking peculiarities of the
modern pronunciation can be traced back, with more or less uniformity,
to a period not far removed from the most flourishing period of Greek
literature, a period certainly when pure Greek was both a spoken and
a written language, and preserving such a living organic power, as
entitled it by a spontaneous impulse from within to modify the laws of
its own orthoepy.</p>

<p>Both these propositions, so far as the vowels are concerned, are proved
by a single glance at the passage of Dionysius (περὶ συντάξεως) already
referred to, and which I shall now translate:—</p>

<p>“There are seven vowels; two long, η and ω, and two short, ε and ο;
three both long and short, α, ι, υ. All these are pronounced by the
wind-pipe acting on the breath, while the mouth remains in its simple
natural state, and the tongue remaining at rest takes no part in the
utterance. Now, the long vowels, and those which may be either long or
short, when they are used as long, are pronounced with the stream of
breath, extended and continuous; but the short vowels, and those used
as short, are uttered by a stroke of the mouth cut off immediately on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
emission, the wind-pipe exerting its power only for the shortest time.
Of all these, the most agreeable sounds are produced by the long
vowels, and those which are used as long, because their sound continues
for a considerable time, and they do not suddenly break off the energy
of the breath. Of an inferior value are the short vowels, and those
used as short, because the volume of sound in them is small and broken.
Of the long again, the most sonorous is the α, when it is used as long,
for it is pronounced by opening the mouth to the fullest, while the
breath strikes the palate. The next is η, because in its formation,
while the mouth is moderately open, the sound is driven out from below
at the mouth of the tongue, and keeping in that quarter does not
strike upwards. Next comes the ω, for in it the mouth is rounded, and
contracts the lips, and the stroke of the mouth is sent against the
extreme end of the mouth, (ἀκροστόμιον, the lips, I presume.) Inferior
to this is the υ, for in this vowel an observable contraction takes
place in the extreme region of the lips, so that the sonorous breath
comes out attenuated and compressed. Last of all comes ι, for here the
stroke of the breath takes place about the teeth, while the opening of
the mouth is small, and the lips contribute nothing towards giving the
sound more dignity as it passes through. Of the short vowels, neither
is sonorous; but o is the least agreeable, for it parts the mouth more
than the other, and receives the stroke nearer the wind-pipe.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span></p>

<p>Now, while every point of this physiological description may not be
curiously accurate,<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
there is enough of obvious certainty in it to settle some of the most
important points of Greek orthoepy, so far as the rhetorician of
Halicarnassus is concerned; and his authority in this matter is that
of a man of the highest skill, which, as the daily practice of our law
courts shows, is worth that of a thousand persons taken at random. That
the <span class="smcap">Itacism</span> of the modern Greeks did not
exist, or was not allowed by good speakers<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
in the time of this writer, so far as the single vowels are concerned,
is abundantly manifest; for not only do η, ι, υ, which the modern
Greeks identify, mean different sounds, but the sound of the η in
particular is removed as far from the ι as it could well be in any
scale of vocalization, which sets out with the supremacy of the broad
<span class="allsmcap">a</span>. And if these sounds were distinguished
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
by polished ears in the days of Augustus Cæsar, it is contrary to
all analogy of language to suppose that in the days of Alexander
the Great, Plato, or Pericles, they should have been confounded.
Provincialisms, indeed, and certain itacizing peculiarities, such as
that noticed by Plato, (<a href="#Page_24">page 24 above</a>), there might have
been; but that any language should confound its vowel-sounds in its best days,
and distinguish them in its days of commencing feebleness, is contrary
to all that succession of things which we daily witness. Different
letters were originally invented to express different sounds, and did
so naturally for a long time, till fashion and freak combined with
habit, either overran the phonetic rule of speech by a rank growth of
exceptive oddities, (as has happened in English,) or fixed upon the
organs of articulation some strong tendency towards the predominance
of a particular sound, which in process of time became a marked
idiosyncrasy, from which centuries of supervening usage could not
shake the language free. This is what has taken place in Greece with
regard to certain vowel-sounds. But before pursuing these observations
further, let us see distinctly what the special points are, that this
remarkable passage of the Halicarnassian distinctly brings out. The
ascertained points are these,—
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>1. The long or slender sound of the English <span
class="allsmcap">a</span>, (as in <i>lane</i>,) is not acknowledged
by Dionysius, nor is its existence possible under his description.
It is altogether an anomaly and a monstrosity—like so many things in
this island—and should never have been tolerated for a moment in the
pronunciation of Latin or Greek.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>2. The slender sound of η used by the English and the modern Greeks,
is an attenuation the farthest possible removed from the conception of
Dionysius. About ε there is no dispute anywhere.</p>

<p>3. The sound of υ described is manifestly the French <i>u</i>, or
German <i>ü</i> heard in <i>Brüder</i>, <i>Bühne</i>: a very delicate
and elegant sound bordering closely on the slender sound of <i>i</i>,
(<i>ee</i>, English,) into which it is sometimes attenuated by the
Germans, and with which, by a poetical license, it is allowed to rhyme,
(as <i>Brüder</i>—<i>nieder</i>,) but having no connection with the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span> English sound
of <i>oo</i>, (as in <i>boom</i>,) with which, in Scotland, it is
confounded. This with us is the more unpardonable, as our Doric dialect
in the south possesses a similar sound in such words as <i>guid</i>,
<i>bluid</i>, attenuated by the Northerns into the slender sound of
<i>gueed</i>, and <i>bleed</i>. The English sound of long <i>u</i> is,
as Walker has pointed out, a compound sound, of which one element is
a sort of consonant—<span class="allsmcap">y</span>. It is, besides,
altogether a piece of English idiosyncrasy, that we have no reason
to suppose ever existed anywhere, either amongst Greeks or
Romans.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>4. The English sound of <span class="allsmcap">i</span> is another
of John Bull’s phonetic crotchets, and must be utterly discarded.
It is, in fact, a compound sound, of which the deep vowel α is the
predominant element—an element which, we have seen, stands at the very
opposite end of the Halicarnassian’s scale!</p>
</div>

<p>So far as we see, therefore, the English, Scotch, and modern Greek
methods of pronouncing the five vowels all depart in some point from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
the highest authority that can be produced on the subject; in fact, the
single vowel ω alone has preserved its full rounded purity uncorrupted
by any party. But with regard to the other four vowels, there is a
marked difference in the degree of deflection from the classical norm;
for, while the Scotch err only in one point, υ, the modern Greeks err
in two, η and υ, (though their error is but a very nice one in the case
of υ, and has, in both cases, long centuries of undeviating usage to
stand on,) and the English err in all the four points, α, η, ι, and
υ, and that in the most paradoxical and abnormal fashion that could
have been invented, had it been the direct purpose of our Oxonian and
Etonian doctors to put all classical propriety at defiance. In such
lawless anarchy has ended the restoration of the divine speech of
Plato, so loftily promised by Sir John Cheke; and so true in this small
matter also, is that wise parable of the New Testament, which advises
reformers to beware of putting new patches on old vestments. Instead of
the robe of genuine Melibean purple which Erasmus wished to throw round
the shoulders of the old Greek gods, our English scholars, following in
his track of conjectural innovation, have produced an English clown’s
motley jacket, which the Zeus of Olympus never saw, and even Momus
would disdain. But let us proceed to the diphthongs.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span></p>

<p>Unhappily Dionysius, by a very unaccountable omission, has given us
no information on this head; so we are left to pursue our inquiries
over a wide field of stray inquiry, and conclude from a greater mass
of materials with much less appearance of scientific certainty. The
following results, however, to any man that will fairly weigh the
cumulative power of the evidence brought together with such laborious
conscientiousness by Liscov and Seyffarth, must appear unquestionable:—</p>

<p>1. It is proved by evidence reaching as far back as the time of the
first Ptolemies, that the diphthong <span class="allsmcap">ai</span> was pronounced like the
same diphthong in our English word <i>gain</i>.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> So the diphthong
is pronounced by the living Greek nation. There is, therefore, the
evidence of more than 2000 years in its favour, and against the
prevalent pronunciation, which gives it the broad sound of <i>ai</i> in
the German word <span class="smcap">kaiser</span>, rhyming pretty nearly with our English
word <span class="smcap">wiser</span>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span></p>

<p>2. The diphthong <span class="smcap">ei</span> was pronounced in the time of Ptolemy
Philadelphus like the English <i>ee</i> in <i>seen</i>, or <i>ea</i>
in <i>beam</i>.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> This pronunciation it retains at the present day.
In this, as in the preceding case, we have a striking proof of the
tenacity with which a great nation clings to elocutional peculiarities.
What likelihood is there that a people, so constant to itself for 2000
years under the most adverse circumstances, should, in the 200 years
previous to that period, have known nothing of what was afterwards one
of its most marked characteristics?</p>

<p>3. The evidence for the pronunciation of the diphthong ΟΙ is more
scanty. Unfortunately the Septuagint translators use this diphthong
only once for expressing a Hebrew name in the whole compass of the
Old Testament. From other evidence, and by a train of deduction that
appears somewhat slippery, Seyffarth comes to the conclusion that its
original pronunciation was probably that of the German <i>oe</i>,
from which it was by degrees softened into the French <i>u</i>, and
lastly into the slender sound of <i>i</i> (<i>ee</i>), which it now
has. But as I am dealing with certainties in this paper, and not with
probabilities, it will be enough to say that <span class="smcap">Liscov</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
has produced evidence to shew that it was confounded with <i>i</i> so early
as the time of Julius Cæsar, <b>ΙΩΝΙΣΤΗΣ</b> being found on a coin of
the great dictator for οἰωνιστής. So in the coins of Emperors of the
second century, <b>ΟΙΚΟΣΤΟΥ</b> frequently occurs for εἰκοστοῦ.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
That λοιμός was not pronounced exactly like λιμός in the time of Thucydides,
has been concluded from a well-known passage in his second book, (c.
54;) but the passage is of doubtful interpretation,<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
and no man can tell at this time of day what the exact, perhaps a very
small shade of, difference, was between the two sounds.</p>

<p>4. In the above three examples, the Scotch and the English have equally
conspired to overthrow the living tradition of two centuries, by an act
of arbitrary academical conceit or pedagogic carelessness. In the case
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
of <span class="smcap">ou</span>, we Northerns have again been happy; while
the English, with their fatal facility of blundering in such matters, have
invented a pronunciation of this diphthong which seems more natural
to a growling Saxon mastiff than to the smooth fulness of ancient
Greek eloquence. The Greek writers, with great uniformity, agree in
expressing by this diphthong the sound of the Latin <i>u</i>; while the
modern Greeks, with equal uniformity, agree in pronouncing their ου
as the Italians pronounce <i>u</i>; that is to say, like the English
<i>oo</i> in <i>boom</i>. Seyffarth classes this diphthong with
<i>a</i> and <i>i</i>, <i>o</i> and <i>e</i>, as a sound about which
there is no controversy.</p>

<p>5. The diphthongs <span class="allsmcap">AU</span> and <span class="allsmcap">EU</span>
follow; and in their case the contrast between the pronunciation of
the living Greeks, and that of those who are taught only out of dead
grammars and dictionaries, is so striking, that the contest has been
peculiarly keen. Here, however, as is wont to be the case in more
important matters, it may be that after much dusty discussion, erudite
wrangling, and inky hostility, it shall turn out that both parties are
in the right. On the first blush of the matter, it seems plain that
such words as βασιλεύς, ναῦν, καλεῦνται, sound extremely harsh, and not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
according to the famous euphony of the Attic ear, if in them the second
letter of the diphthong receive the consonantal sound of <i>v</i> or
<i>f</i> given by the modern Greeks. <b><span class="smcap">Vasilefs,
Nafn, Calefntae</span></b>—these are sounds which no chaste classic ear
can tolerate, and which, among the phenomena of human articulation, are
more naturally classed with such harsh Germanisms as <i>Pfingst</i>,
<i>Probst</i>, &amp;c., than with any sound that can be imagined to
have been wedded euphoniously to Apollo’s lute. All this is very true;
and yet, as modern German is not all harsh, so ancient Greek, it may
be, was not all mellow; and no mere general talk about euphony or
cacophony can, in so freakish a thing as human speech, be allowed to
settle any question of orthoepy. Now, when we look into the matter an
inch beyond the film of such shallow scholastic declamation, we find
that so early as the time of Crassus, that is, in the first half of
the first century before the Christian era, the diphthong <i>au</i>,
which we pronounce <i>ou</i>, (as in <i>bound</i>,) and the English
like the same vowel in their own language, (as in <i>vault</i>,) was
actually enunciated consonantally like <i>av</i> or <i>af</i>. For
Cicero (Divinat. ii. 40) tells the anecdote how, when that unfortunate
soldier was on his way to the East, and about embarking in a ship at
Brundusium, he happened to meet a Greek on the quay calling out <span
class="smcap">Caunias!</span>  by which call the basket
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
slung over his shoulder might have plainly indicated that he meant
<span class="smcap">Figs!</span> figs of the best quality (worthy
of a triumvir) from Caunus, in the south-west corner of Asia Minor;
but the triumvir’s ear—dark destiny brooding in his soul—caught
up the syllables separately, as <i>Cav’ ne eas</i>—<b><span
class="smcap">Beware how you go!</span></b> Now, as no person pretends
that the <i>v</i> in <i>caveo</i> was pronounced like the <i>u</i>
in <i>causa</i>, or could be so scanned in existing Latin poetry, it
follows that the <i>au</i> in Caunias was pronounced by a Greek of
those times as a <i>v</i> or <i>f</i>, exactly as the living Greeks
pronounce it now. This is one example, among the many that we have
adduced, shewing in a particularly striking way how impossible it is
for modern schoolmasters, judging from mere abstract considerations,
and bad scholastic habits, to say how the ancient Greeks might or might
not have pronounced any particular combination of sounds. No doubt this
Calabrian fig-merchant might not have pronounced that combination of
letters exactly in the same way that Pericles did 400 years earlier,
when, from the tribunal on the Athenian Pnyx, with the ominous roar
of a thirty years’ war in his ear, “he lightened and thundered and
confounded Greece;” but there is no reason, on the other hand, why a
Greek fig-merchant and a Greek statesman should not have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
pronounced certain rough syllables in the same way, (for a great orator
requires rough as well as smooth syllables;) and this much at least is
certain, the anecdote proves that the modern pronunciation of αὐτός,
<i>aftos</i>, is ancient as well as modern; and the talk of those who
will have it that this, and other most characteristic sounds of the
living orthoepy, were introduced by the Turks and the Venetians, or the
Greeks themselves under their perverse influence, is mere talk—talk of
that kind in which scholastic men are fond of indulging, when, knowing
nothing, they wish to have it appear that they know everything. What
was the real state of the pronunciation with regard to this and the
other diphthong ευ in the days of Pericles or Plato, we have no means
of knowing. Meanwhile the result which Seyffarth, after a long and
learned investigation, brings out, that they were pronounced before
a vowel as <i>v</i>, or the German <i>w</i>, and before a consonant
as a real diphthong, seems probable enough. This agrees both with the
natural laws of elocutional physiology, and explains how the imperial
name <span class="smcap">Flavius</span> in Roman coins (<i>Liscov</i>,
p. 51) came to be written sometimes <b>ΦΛΑΥΙΟΣ</b> and sometimes
<b>ΦΛΑΒΙΟΣ</b>. However this be, there is no doubt that the consonantal
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
pronunciation of these letters has for more than 1800 years been known
among the Greeks. It has therefore all the claims that belong to a
venerable conservatism; whereas, if we reject its title, we throw
ourselves loose into an element of mere conjecture; as no person can
tell us whether Demosthenes pronounced αυ in the Scotch or English
way, (supposing one of the two to be right;) and as for ευ, what
extraordinary feats the human tongue can play with it, we may learn
from the Germans, who pronounce it like <i>oy</i> in our <i>boy</i>—a
rare lesson to the restorers of a lost pronunciation how much is to be
learnt in such a field from mere argument and analogy!</p>

<p>Let us now collect the different points of this inquiry under a single
glance. In the days of the first Emperors, and, in a majority of cases,
as early as the first Ptolemies, the scale of Greek vocalization,
according to the best evidence now obtainable, was as follows:—</p>

<p>Now, in stating the results thus, I wish it to be observed in the
first place, that I throw no sort of doubt on the possibility that
in the days of Herodotus and Pericles some of the diphthongal sounds
here declared normal in the days of the Ptolemies and the Cæsars might
have been pronounced otherwise. The theory of Pennington, also, (p.
51), that there might have co-existed in ancient times a system of
orthoepy for reciting the old poets, considerably different from that
used in common conversation, may be entertained by whosoever pleases,
and is not without its uses; but in the present purely practical
inquiry we must leave all mere theory out of view. It is also perfectly
open to Liscov, or any philologist, working out a suggestion of the
great Herman, to prove from the internal analogy of the language, and
especially from a comparison of the most ancient dialects,<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
that <i>originally</i> the diphthongs were pronounced differently from what
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
they are now, and were in the days of Ptolemy Philadelphus, (Homer
unquestionably said, παις—<i>païs</i>, and not <i>pace</i>. II.
<i>Z</i>, 467;) but in the present investigation, as a practical man,
I want something better than general probabilities and philosophical
negations, or even isolated correct assertions; I want a complete
scheme of Greek pronunciation, for some particular age, congruous
within itself, and standing on something like historical evidence.
This I find only in the pronunciation of the modern Greeks, or in that
of the Ptolemies and Cæsars, which differs from the other only in a
very few points. What then, we may ask, should hinder us from at once
adopting this pronunciation? Nothing, I imagine, but the dull inertness
of mere conservatism, (which in such matters is very potent,) the
conceit of academical men, proud of their own clumsy invention, and
the dread of <span class="smcap">Itacism</span>. Is it not monstrous,
we hear it said, that half a dozen different vowels, or combinations
of vowels, should be pronounced in the same way, and that in such
a fashion as only curs yelp, and mice squeak, and tenuous shades
with feeble whine flit through the airy paths that lead to Pluto’s
unsubstantial hall? Now, I at once admit that the prevalence of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
slender sound of <i>i</i> (<i>ee</i>), is a corruption from the
original purity of Hellenic vocalization, from which I have no doubt
the Pelasgi, and the venerable patriarchs who put up the lions, now
seen on the gates of Mycenæ, were free; but no language spoken by
a polished people is free from some corruption of this kind; and
this particular corruption, like the defects observable in men of
great original genius, is characteristic. In such strongly marked
men as Beethoven, Samuel Johnson, and John Hunter the physiologist,
nothing is more easy than for the nice moralist to point out half a
dozen points of character that he could have wished otherwise. So
it is with language. Who, for instance, would not wish to reform
the capriciousness of our English systemless system of spelling
and pronunciation? Who can say that we have not too much of the
sibilant sound of <i>s</i> and <i>th</i> in our language? who will
not lament the want of body in our vocalization, and the tendency
to the ineffective tribrachic and even proceleusmatic accent in the
termination of our polysyllables? In German, again, who does not
indulge in a spurt of indignation against “<i>Wenn Ich mich nicht</i>,”
and other such common collocations of gutturals? and in Italian are we
not so cloyed with <i>ōnes</i> and <i>āres</i>, and other broad
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
trochaic modulations, that we long for the resurrection of some Gothic
Quinctilian to inoculate the luscious “<i>lingua Toscana in bocca
Romana</i>,” with a few harsh solecisms; while the French, who for
cleverness and refinement, (and some other things also,) are a sort of
Greeks, do so clip and mince the stout old Roman lingo, which they have
adopted, that except in the mouth of flower girls and ballet dancers,
their dialect is altogether intolerable to many a masculine ear. All
these things are true; but no sane man thinks of rebelling against such
hereditary characteristics of a human language, any more than he would
against the ingrained peculiarities of human character. We take these
things as we find them; just as we must make the best of a snub nose,
or a set of bad teeth in an otherwise pretty face. So also we must
even attune our ears to the Itacism of the Greeks; otherwise we shall
assuredly sin against a notable characteristic of the language, much
more intimately connected with the genius of that singular people, than
many a clipper of new Greek grammars and filcher of notes to old Attic
plays imagines. What says <span class="smcap">Quinctilian</span>?
<i>Non possumus esse tam</i> <span class="smcap">graciles</span>;
<i>simus</i> <span class="smcap">Fortiores</span>, (xii. 10.) Now, I
ask the defenders of our modern system of pronouncing Greek in this
country, which some of them perhaps call classical and Erasmian,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
but which is in fact, as has been proved, an incoherent jabber of
barbarisms, what if the so much decried <i>Itacism</i> were part
of this <i>gracilitas</i>, this slenderness or tenuity of ancient
Hellenic speech, by which it was to the ear of the greatest of Latin
rhetoricians so strikingly distinguished from the Roman? Certain it
is, that the rude Teutonic sounds of <i>ou</i> and <i>i</i>, (English
<i>i</i> and <i>ai</i> in <i>Kaiser</i>), that we hear so often in
English Greek, do not answer to Quinctilian’s description. In fact,
both English and Scotch, instead of preserving this natural contrast
between Greek and Roman enunciation, have in this, and in other
matters, (as we shall see presently, when we come to talk of accents,)
done everything in their power to sweep it away; and of nothing am I
more firmly convinced than of this, that a living conception of what
the spoken Greek language really was in its best days, will never
be attained by any scholar who has not the courage to kick all the
Erasmian academic gear aside for a season, and take a free amble
with some living Christopoulos, or Papadopoulos, on the banks of the
Ilissus, or round the base of Lycabettus. This living experience of the
language is indeed the only efficient way to argue against the learned
prejudices of academic men; for, as <span class="smcap">Thiersch</span> well
observes, every one laughs at that pronunciation to which he has not been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
accustomed, (<i>Sprachlehre</i>, sect. xvii. 3;) and no man can live
at Athens for any time, without having his ears reconciled to a slight
deviation from perfect euphony, or even coming to admire it, as one
sometimes does the lisp of a pretty woman, or the squint of an arch
humorist.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>So much for the vowel-sounds. I say nothing of the consonants, because
they are of less consequence in the controversy. I have already spoken incidentally
about β, (<a href="#Page_21">p. 21 above</a>), and I have no wish to write a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
complete treatise. Detailed information on minute points of
neo-Hellenic pronunciation may be found in Pennington’s work already
quoted, and in a recent work by Corpe.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
I now proceed to the matter of <span class="smcap">accent</span>, which
we shall find to be no less important, but happily much more easily settled.</p>

<p>“In the pronunciation of a Greek word,” says <span class="smcap">Jelf</span>,<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
“regard ought to be had both to accent and quantity;” a most significant
power lying in that word <span class="allsmcap">OUGHT</span>, as we know well
that many teachers in this country pay a very irregular regard to quantity in
reading, and very few, if any, pay any regard to accent.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
But that the proposition laid down by Mr. <span class="smcap">Jelf</span>
is true, no scholar can doubt for a moment, though Mr.
<span class="smcap">Pennington</span>, in the year 1844, most evidently
anticipated a great amount of stolidity, obstinacy, and scepticism,
among his academic friends on this point; with such minute and
scrupulous care, and breadth of philological preparation does he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
set himself to prove, what no man that had ever dipped into an ancient
Greek grammar, or a common Latin work on rhetoric, would ever dream of
denying. However, I gave myself some trouble to set forth this matter
learnedly some years ago,<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
knowing that I might have to do with persons not always open to
reason, and utterly impervious to nature and common sense; and the
Fellow of King’s also might have had occasion to know that it is one
thing to prick soft flesh with a pin, another to drive nails into a
stone wall. The fact is, that the living Greek language having come
down to us with most audible accentuation, and the signs of these
accents being contained in all printed Greek books, and not only so,
but commented on by a long series of grammarians, from Herodian and
Arcadius, down through the Homeric bishop of Thessalonica, to Gaza and
Lascaris; in this state of the case, if any man does not pronounce
Greek according to accents, while I do, the burden of proof lies with
him who throws off all established authority in the matter, not with me
who acknowledge it. If there is no authority for accent in the ancient
grammarians, then as little is there for quantity. The fact of the
existence of the one as a living characteristic of the spoken
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
and written language of ancient Greece, stands exactly on the same
foundation as the other. So many ancient grammars, and comments on
grammars have been published within the last fifty years by Bekker
and other library-excavators, that the teacher who now requires to be
taught formally that the ancients really used accents in their public
elocution, is more worthy of a good flogging than the greatest dunce
in his drill. But what were accents? Accents are an <i>intension</i>
and <i>remission</i> (ἐπίτασις and ἄνεσις) of the voice in articulate
speech, whereby one syllable receives a marked predominance over the
others, this predominance manifesting itself principally in a higher
note or intonation given to the accented syllable.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
This definition occurs fifty times if it occurs once in the works of
the ancient grammarians and rhetoricians; so I need not trouble myself
here by an array of erudite citations to prove it; and that such an
accent is both possible and easy to bring out in the case of any Greek
word, may be experienced by anybody who will pronounce κεφαλή with a
marked rise of the voice on the last syllable, or νεφέλη with a similar
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
intension of vocal utterance on the penult. That the living Greeks
give a distinct prominence to these very syllables, any man may learn
by seeking them out in Manchester or London, in both which places they
have a chapel. Why then should Etonian schoolmasters, and Oxonian
lecturers not do the same? Do they not teach the doctrine of accents?
Have they not translated <span class="smcap">Goettling</span>? Do they
not print all their books with those very marks which Aristophanes of
Byzantium, two thousand years ago, with provident cunning, devised even
for this purpose, that we, studious academic men, in the then <span
class="smcap">Ultima Thule</span> of civilisation, should now have the
pleasure of intoning a philosophic period as the divine Plato did, or
a blast of patriotic indignation as Demosthenes? They say there are no
accents properly so called in the French language. This I never could
exactly understand; but do our academic men actually realize this
peculiar form of levelled human enunciation, (the ὁμαλισμὸς of the old
grammarians,) without intension or remission, by pronouncing Greek
altogether unaccented? Believe it not. As if determined to produce a
scholastic impersonation of every possible monstrosity with regard to
the finest language in the world, they neglect the written accents
which lie before their nose, and read according to those accents which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
they have borrowed from the Latin! and this directly in the teeth of
the public declaration of <span class="smcap">Cicero</span> and <span
class="smcap">Quinctilian</span>, that Latin had one monotonous law of
accentuation, Greek another and a much more rich and various
one.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
And, as if to place the top-stone on the pyramid of absurdities which
they pile, after reading Greek with this Latin accent (which sounds to
a Greek ear exactly as a rude Frenchman’s first attempts at English
sound to an Englishman) for some half dozen years, they set seriously
to cram their brain-chambers with rules how Greek accents should be
placed, and exercise their memory and their eye, with a most villainous
abuse of function, in doing that work which should have been done from
the beginning by the ear! If consistency could have been looked for
from men involved in such a labyrinth of bungling, there would have
been something heroic in throwing away the marks altogether from their
books and from their brains, as well as from their tongue; certainly
this procedure would have saved many a peeping editor a great deal of
trouble, and many a brisk young gentleman riding up in a Cambridge
“coach” right into the possession of a snug tutorship in Trinity, would
have travelled on a smoother road, and felt less seriously how the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
flowers of ancient literature are scarce to be enjoyed amid the
thorns of modern grammar that besiege a man’s fingers and eyes from
all sides.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
 But intellectual consistency is not to be expected from
persons once involved in a gross error, any more than moral consistency
is from thieves; and it is well for all parties that it is so; for by
this wise arrangement of nature, as a thief’s story often discovers
the theft it would conceal, so a philologer’s nonsense is most readily
refuted by the remnants of incoherent sense that he had not wit or
courage enough to eliminate. Besides, the dictum of <span class="smcap">Porson</span>
stood mighty over their heads;<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
and as for the young men, the more time that was wasted on a reasonless
method of teaching Greek, the less danger would there be of that rude
invasion of <span class="smcap">Botany, Geology, History</span>, and
all the array of modern sciences which has long been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
the special terror of English academic men. So they went on, and
so they go on now, teaching that people ought to accent κεφαλή on
the last syllable, and yet actually accenting it on the first! The
consequence of which perverse proceeding is not only that accents
are one of the most difficult things to learn in Greek, and seldom
thoroughly mastered even by those who are excellent scholars otherwise,
(<i>see</i> <span class="smcap">Jelf</span>, page 52, <i>note</i>), but an
accomplished English scholar, when he makes his continental tour, as is
common enough in these days, even with men who have not much money, finds
that his perverse enunciation of the Greek vowels, combined with his
utter neglect of accents, has put him in possession of a language of
which he can make no use except in soliloquy, and which any person can
understand sooner than a native of the country to which it belongs.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
He then comes home belike and tells his English friends that the modern
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
Greeks are a set of barbarians, who speak a “swallow’s jabber,” so
corrupt that no scholar can understand a word they say! So true is
the record which honest Thomas Fuller has left of the issue of the
notable Hellenic controversy raised by Sir John Cheke—“Here Bishop
Gardiner, chancellor of the university, interposed his power, affirming
Cheke’s pronunciation, pretended to be ancient, to be antiquated. He
imposed a penalty on all such as used this new pronunciation, which,
notwithstanding, since hath prevailed, and whereby we Englishmen speak
Greek and are able to understand one another, <i>which nobody else
can</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>Let us now ask in a single sentence how all this mass of absurdity came
about; for we may depend upon it a whole array of brave philologic
hoplites cannot have stumbled on their way suddenly without the
apparition of some real or imaginary ghost. The ghost that frightened
them on the present occasion, and caused them to forswear <span class="smcap">spoken
accent</span> (for as we have seen they stuck to it on <span class="smcap">paper</span>)
was <span class="smcap">quantity</span>; concerning which, therefore, we must now
inquire, whether it be a real ghost or only a white sheet. Quantity,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
they say, cannot stand before Accent, or rather is swallowed up by it.
Like hostile religious sects, or belligerent medical corporations,
they cannot meet without quarrelling; so the public peace is consulted
by getting rid of one of them, not in the way of violent murder,
(for the law does not allow that,) but by what certain philosophical
Chartist-Reformers used to call “painless extinction.” Therefore they
who speak according to accent, are wont to remove quantity out of
the way noiselessly; and they who speak according to quantity must
treat accent in the same way. This is an old story. The <span class="smcap">Bear</span>
in Erasmus’ dialogue, (Havercamp, ii. 95,) speaking rare wisdom in
a gruff Johnsonian sort of style, says, “<i>Sunt quidam adeo</i>
<span class="smcap">crassi</span> <i>ut non distinguant accentum a quantitate, quum
sit longe diversa ratio</i>. <b><span class="smcap">Aliud est enim acutum aliud
diu tinnire: aliud intendi, aliud extendi.</span></b> <i>At eruditos
novi qui, quum pronunciarent illud</i> ἀνέχου καὶ ἀπέχου, <i>mediam
syllabam, quoniam tonum habet acutum, quantum possent producerent, quum
sit natura brevis vel brevissima potius</i>.” Certain learned men, it
appears, in the beginning of the sixteenth century, could not accent
the word ἀνέχου on the penult, as it ought to be accented, without in
the same breath making that syllable long, which it is not. To avoid
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
this blunder, the Etonians, Oxonians, and other famous modern teachers,
omit the accent altogether on that syllable and on every syllable—of
which the name is legion—similarly situated in the Greek language,
and thus, by removing the cause, are sure of annihilating the effect.
A very obvious, but surely a very clumsy expedient, and hardly worthy
of the subtlety of the academic mind. A man by running too hard
sometimes breaks his legs; and you forthwith vow to avoid his fate
by sitting in your chair constantly and taking no exercise! Let us
see how the case stands here. The accent, you say, lengthens the
syllable. Take any English word in the first place, (as nonsense is
not so transparent in a learned tongue,) and make the experiment. If
a Scotsman says <i>véesible</i>, you will allow, I suppose, that the
first syllable of that word is both long and accented: if an Englishman
says <i>viśible</i>, ’tis equally clear that the same syllable is still
accented, but it is not now long. Accent, therefore, in English has no
necessary power to lengthen the sound of the vowel of the syllable on
which it is placed; and if some learned men on the banks of the Rhine,
in the days of Erasmus, or on the banks of the Isis, in our day, cannot
accent a syllable without at the same time lengthening it, this happens
merely because, as the Bear says, they are “<span class="smcap">adeo crassi</span>;”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
their ears are gross, and have lost—by the dust of the libraries,
perhaps—the healthy power of discerning differences of modulation in
the living human voice. Not a few persons have I met with among those
who are, or would be scholars, in this country, who in this way assert
that it is impossible to put the accent on the penult of a Greek word,
and at the same time, as the law of the language requires, make the
last syllable long. But these persons had got their ears confounded
by the traditionary jargon of teachers inculcating from dead books a
doctrine of which they had no living apprehension; and this, along with
the utter neglect of musical and elocutionary culture so common among
our classical devotees, had rendered them incapable of perceiving,
without an act of special attention, the commonest phenomena of spoken
language appealing to the ear. In the English words <i>echo</i>,
<i>primrose</i>, and many other of the same description, the accent and
quantity stand in that exact relation which is so characteristic of
Greek, as in ἔχω, λόγῳ; while in the English words <i>clód-pated</i>,
<i>hoúsekeeper</i>, we have that precise disposal of accent and
quantity which occurs in the word ἄνθρωπος, and which has been so
often quoted as a proof that it is impossible to give effect to accent
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
without violating quantity.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
A very slight elocutionary culture would put a stop to such vain talk;
but we have, unfortunately, too many scholars who gather their crude
notions on such subjects from a few phrases current in the schools,
without ever questioning their own ears, the only proper witness
of what is right or wrong in the matter of enunciation. Hence the
cumbrous mass of erudite nonsense on accent and quantity under which
our library shelves groan; hence the host of imaginary difficulties and
impossibilities that birch-bearing men will raise when you tell them
to perform the simplest act of perception of which an unsophisticated
human ear is capable. “<i>Vel ab</i> <span class="smcap">Asinis</span>
<i>licebat hoc discrimen discere</i>,” continues the learned Bear,
“<i>qui rudentes corripiunt acutam vocem, imam producunt</i>.” Very
true; a really wise man may learn much from an ass; but they who
conceit themselves to be wise, when they are not, will learn from
nobody. And so I conclude with regard to this whole matter of <span
class="smcap">quantity</span>, that it is only an imaginary ghost after
all; a white sheet which a single touch of the finger will turn aside,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
or only a white mist, perhaps, which, if a brave man will only march up
to, he shall not know that it is there.</p>

<p>One thing, however, I will admit—by way of palliation for the enormous
blunders that have been committed in this matter—that in words of
two, three, or more syllables, where the accent is on a syllable
naturally short, while the long syllable is unaccented, a careless
speaker may readily slur over the long syllable so as to make it
short, thus converting an anapæst accented on the first syllable, as</p>

<ul class="index no-wrap fontsize_120">
<li class="isub1">&nbsp; &nbsp;<big>ˏ</big></li>
<li class="isub1"><i>cĕlăndīne</i>,&emsp;into a tribrach with the same accent</li>
<li class="isub1">&nbsp; &nbsp;<big>ˏ</big></li>
<li class="isub1"><i>cĕlăndīn</i>,</li>
</ul>

<p class="no-indent">a very common vulgarism, as we all know. The unaccented
syllable, indeed, is, in the very nature of things, placed in a position where
it is not so likely to get its fair mass of sound as its accented
neighbour. Thus, except in solemn speaking, the first syllable of
<b>ŌBĒDĬĔNT</b> seldom gets full weight, though it is equally long with its
accented sequent; and the second syllable of <span class="smcap">education</span>
is vulgarized into <i>edication</i>, purely from the want of the accent.
But that such vulgarisms should form any bar in the way of academical
men doing proper justice to the correct elocution of the Greeks
is really too bad. The modern Greeks, indeed, we know, go a step
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
farther;<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
they not only in their common conversation fail to give the
due prolongation to their long syllables, when unaccented—making no
distinction between ω and ο—but they actually give <i>extension</i>
as well as <i>intension</i> to all their accented syllables, and thus
fall into the same sin as respects quantity that our academicians daily
commit against accent. But there is not the slightest reason why we
should imagine it necessary to imitate them in this idiosyncrasy. To
do so would be for the sake of a superfluous compliment to the living,
to cut off one great necessary organ, whereby the beautiful wisdom of
the dead being made alive again becomes ours. The laws of accent are
a most important element of the oratory of Pericles and Demosthenes;
but without quantity the harmony of Homer’s numbers is unintelligible.
There is no reason why we should sacrifice either the one or the other
of these two great modulating principles of ancient Hellenic speech.
The one, so far from destroying, does, in fact, regulate to a certain
extent,<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
and beautifully vary the other. Quantity without accent were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
a monotonous level of dreary sing-song; accent without quantity can
be likened only to a series of sharp parallel ridges, with steep
narrow ravines interposed, but without the amplitude of grassy slope,
flowering mead, and far-stretching fields of yellow-waving corn.</p>

<p>But some one will still press the question, <i>How am I to read Homer?
how Sophocles?</i> Is it not manifest, that if I read according to the
spoken accent, and not according to the quantitative metre, though I
may preserve myself, by decent care, from grossly violating quantity,
I shall certainly fail to bring out anything that the ear of the most
harshly-modulated Hottentot or Cherokee could recognise as rhythm? Now
what has been said hitherto of the compatibility of accent and quantity
relates only to words taken separately, or as they occur in the loose
succession of unfettered speech—a purely elocutional matter: of the
musical element of rhythm nothing has been said. That this must modify
the singing or recitation of measured verses to a considerable extent,
so as to make it different from the oratorical declamation of prose,
is evident; but that there is no such incomprehensible mystery in the
matter, as some people imagine, I hope I shall be able to make plain in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
a very few words. The poetry of the ancients differed from the mass of
that now written in nothing more than in this, that it was considered
as a living element of the existing music, and exercised in subjection
to the laws of that divine art. Now the singing of words in music has
the effect of bringing out more prominently the mass of vocal sound
in the words, or what the prosodians in their technical style call
quantity, while the spoken accent—unless it be identified with the
musical accent or rhythmical beat—is apt to be overwhelmed altogether
and superseded. That this must be the case the very nature of the thing
shows; but we have a distinct testimony of an ancient musical writer
to this effect, which will be useful to those who in all matters are
constitutionally apt to depend more on authority than on
reason.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
This explains why, in the ancient treatises on poetical measures, we
find not a word said about the spoken accent. If the full musical value
of each foot, (or bar, as we call it,) in point of vowel-fulness,
according to an established sequence be given, the poet is considered
to have done his duty to the musician; the rhythmical beat, or musical
accent, accompanies the measured succession of bars, as with us, but the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
spoken accent is disregarded. Of all this in our elocutional poetry
we do, and must, in the nature of things, do the very reverse. Poetry
composed primarily for recitation must follow the laws of spoken
speech; and the spoken accent being the most prominent element in that
speech, becomes of course the great regulator of poetical rhythm.
Quantity, as the secondary element of spoken speech, though the
principal thing in music, is not indeed neglected altogether, but left
to the free disposal of the poet, so that the technical structure of
his verse is in no wise bound by it. The musician then comes in, and
finding that he has no liberty in the matter of the spoken accent,
(the public ear being altogether formed on that,) exercises his large
discretion in the matter of quantity, drawing out, without ceremony, a
spoken quaver into a sung minim, or cutting short a spoken minim into
a sung quaver. Now this license, familiar as it is to us, would have
strangely startled, and appeared almost ludicrous to a Greek ear; and
by the same effect of mere custom, we have to explain the fact, that
the practice of composing poetry, without any reference to the spoken
accent, practised by the ancients, appears to us so extraordinary. In
our attempts to explain it, we have sometimes altogether lost out of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
view the fact, that music and conversational speech, though kindred
arts, and arts in the ancient practice of poetry indissolubly wedded,
have each their own distinctive tendencies and laws, to which full
effect cannot easily be given while they act together; and every such
case of joint action must accordingly be, to a certain extent—like the
harmonious practice of connubial life—a compromise. My conclusion,
therefore, with regard to the reading of Homer and Sophocles is, in
the first place, that they were never intended to be read in our sense
of the word, that they are not constructed on reading principles, and
that, when we do recite them—as the ancients themselves no doubt
likewise did—we must read them in a manner that makes as near an
approach as possible to the musical principles on which they were
constructed. With regard to the strictly lyrical parts of poetry, as
Pindar and the tragic choruses, I have no hesitation in saying, that
the only proper way to obtain a full perception of their rhythmical
beauty, is to sing or chant them to any extemporized melody, (which
would be much more readily done were not music so unworthily neglected
in our higher schools;) while with regard to the dialogic parts of the
drama, which were declaimed and not sung by the ancients themselves,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
the teacher must take care to accustom his pupils to a deep and mellow
fulness of vocalization, and a deliberate stateliness of verbal
procession, as much as possible the reverse of that hasty trip with
which we are accustomed to read the dialogue of our dramatic poetry.
The musical accent, or rhythmical beat, will, of course, in such a
method of recitation, receive a marked prominence; the long quantity
will never be slurred; and with regard to the spoken accent, what I
say is this, the ear of the student must first be trained in reading
prose never to omit the accent, and accustomed to feel, by the living
iteration of the ear, that both accent and quantity are an essential
part of the word. This many schoolmasters will not do, because it
requires science, and will take a little trouble; but let such pass.
Those who do so train the young classical ear, will find that in
turning to poetry, and keeping time with their foot as they read any
metre, the attentive scholar will not only readily follow the given
rhythm, and appreciate the position of the musical accent, (very few
human beings being altogether destitute of the rhythmical principle,)
but will be able also to preserve the spoken accent in those places
where the flow of the rhythm does not altogether overpower it. What I
mean is this. In the line, for instance,</p>

<p class="f120"><b>οὐλομένην ἣ μυρἴ Ἀχαιοῖς ἄλγε’ ἔθηκεν</b>,</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
the second of the Iliad, the boy who has been properly trained to put
the accent on the penult of οὔλομένην, preserving the long quantity
of the final syllable, will, even though he retains that accent in
the rhythmical declamation of the line, find no impediment to the
rhythmical progress of the verse, but rather an agreeable variety, and
an antidote against monotony; and though, on account of the strong
effect which the rhythm always exercises on the closing word of the
line, it will be difficult to give the full effect to the spoken accent
on the antepenultimate of ἔθηκεν, while the closing musical accent lies
on the penult, nevertheless, a person who has been accustomed always to
pronounce this word in prose with its proper accent and quantity, will
bring out the first syllable of the word much more distinctly than is
done in the sing-song of a merely rhythmical recitation, and will not
spoil the verse, but rather improve it. And if any person asks me how I
prove that the ancients read Homer this way, I might content myself by
giving a Scotch answer, and asking, <i>How do you prove that they read
it your way?</i> But, in fact, there is no possibility of their having
read it otherwise; for having once introduced the habit of reading
compositions, constructed originally on musical, not elocutional
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
principles, with that habit they could not but bring in as much of
the element of their spoken language as was consistent with the
musical principle on which the very existence of the composition,
as a rhythmical work of art, depended; that is to say, they allowed
the musical principle of quantitative rhythm to prevail over the
elocutional principle of accent, so far only as to produce harmony, not
so far as to fatigue with monotony.</p>

<p>The reader will observe that I am not theorizing in all this, but
speaking from experience; and therefore I speak with confidence. For
ten years I read the Latin poets in Aberdeen, and I found no difficulty
in reading them so as to combine the living effect of both accent and
quantity, and teaching the student both by the ear alone. The first
line of Virgil, to take an example, in respect of accent and quantity,
may be read three ways. Either</p>

<p class="no-indent">I take notice of these two words <span
class="smcap">cano</span> and <span class="smcap">Trojǽ</span>, only
because they are the only two in which the musical accent of this line
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span> clashes with the
spoken accent, the rules of which, though not marked in Latin books as
in Greek, were preserved by the living tradition of the Roman Catholic
Church, and the accentual Latin poetry of their Service, and are
observed by our schoolmasters as faithfully (without knowing it, many
of them) as they violate the accent of the Greek. Now, of these three
ways of reading a Latin hexameter, the second is the only one which
proceeds upon the principle of the quantitative rhythm exclusively,
observing the spoken accent only where it happens to coincide with it,
(as happens here in four bars of the six;) while the first, which is
the vulgar English way, asserts the dominancy of the spoken accent in
all the six cases; and yet, as the clash only takes place in two cases,
preserves, without effort, (as I have just said with regard to Homer,)
the flow of the musical rhythm. With that grossness of ear, however,
which Erasmus and his learned Bear noticed in the learned of his day,
they fall with respect to Latin, plump into the extreme error practised
by the modern Greeks, and cannot accentuate the first syllable of <span
class="smcap">cano</span>, without lengthening it, while the final
syllable of the same word is generally deprived of its natural amount
of sound, a strange error for a people to make with whom Latin
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
verse making (I shall not say with what propriety) forms so prominent
a part of school-discipline; but there is no end to their absurdities,
no limit to their contradictions; the fact being, as one of themselves
has distinctly stated,<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
that the “composition of classical verses
with them is almost entirely <span class="smcap">mechanical</span>;” and yet
they have the assurance to hold up this scholastic abortion to the admiration
of the public as one of the indispensable elements in the training of that
improved edition of the ancient Roman—John Bull. But to finish. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
third method of recitation is, I think, the correct one. It violates
neither quantity nor accent, but makes the one play with an
agreeable variety over the other, as we see the iridescent colours
in a gown of shot silk. I think I have now answered the question
satisfactorily—<i>How is Homer to be read?</i> If anything remains
unclear, I shall be happy to communicate personally with any person who
has an ear.</p>

<p>Before concluding these observations, I have one or two remarks to
make on <span class="smcap">modern Greek</span>, which have a vital connexion
with the state of the argument. The reader will observe that I have from the
beginning spoken of Greek as a living language, having had a continuous
uninterrupted existence, though under various and well-marked
modifications, from the days of Cadmus and his earth-sown brood to the
present hour. Now the vulgar notion is, that Romaic, as it used to be
called, though the present Greeks have with a just pride, I understand,
rejected the epithet, is not only a different dialect of the Greek,
from that spoken by Plato and Demosthenes, but a different language
altogether, in the same way that Italian and Spanish are languages
formed on Latin indeed, but with an organic type altogether their own.
In this view Greek becomes a dead language; and the mass of scholastic
and academical men who teach it habitually as such, without any regard
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
to its existing state, will receive a justification of which they are
not slow to make use. But this vulgar notion, like many others, has
grown out of pedantic prejudice, and is supported by sheer ignorance.
How such a notion should have got abroad is easy enough to explain. I
mentioned already, that the English scholars—who have been allowed
to give the law on such subjects—have so completely disfigured the
classical features of Greek speech, that when they happen to meet
Greeks, or to travel in Greece and attempt conversation, they can
make no more of the answer they receive, than they can of the twitter
of swallows, or the language of any other bird. Again, at Oxford and
Cambridge, as is well known, the majority confine themselves to a very
limited range even of strictly classical Greek, so that a man may
well have received high honours for working up his Æschylus and his
Aristotle, and yet be quite unfit to make out the meaning of a plain
modern Greek book when he sees it; but the fact is, I have good reason
to believe, there is not one among a hundred of their scholars that
ever saw such a thing. Thirdly, we must consider under what a system of
prim classical prudery these gentlemen are often brought up. They are
taught to believe, and have been taught here also in Scotland publicly,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
that after a certain golden age of Attic or Atticizing purity, the
limits of which are very arbitrarily fixed, a race of Greek writers
succeeded who “increased immensely the vocabulary of the language,
while they injured its simplicity and debased its beauty;” and under
the influence of this salutary fear they regard with a strong jealousy
whole centuries of the most interesting and instructive authors who do
not come under their arbitrary definition of “classical.” Men who think
that the vocabulary of the Hellenic language should have been finally
closed at the time of Polybius, and who pass a philologic interdict
against any phrase or idiom introduced after that period, will not be
very likely to look with peculiar favour on the prose of Perrhæbus,
or the poetry of Soutzos. But by a large-minded philologist all this
prudery is disregarded. He knows that grammarians can as little cause
a language to be corrupted and to die, by any dainty squeamishness of
theirs, as they with their meagre art can create a single word, or
manufacture one verse of a poem. Looking at the language of Homer and
Plato as a real historical phenomenon, and not as a mere record in
grammatical books, he sees that it went on growing and putting forth
fresh buds and blossoms long after nice lexicographers had declared
that it ceased to possess vitality. A language lives as long as a people
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
lives—a distinct and tangible social totality—speaking it, nor
has it the power to die at any point, where grammarians may choose
to draw a line, and say that its authors are no longer classical.
What “classical” means is hard to say; but as a matter of fact many
persons will read the Byzantine historians with much more pleasure
than Xenophon’s Hellenics, and not be able to explain intelligibly why
the Greek of the one should not be considered as good as the Greek of
the other. Greek certainly was not a dead language in any sense at
the taking of Constantinople in the year 1453. If it is dead, it has
died since that date; but the facts to those who will examine them,
prove that it is not dead. No doubt, under the oppressive atmosphere
of Turkish and Venetian domination, the stout old tree began to
droop visibly, and became encrusted with leprous scabs, and to shew
livid blotches, which were not pleasant to behold; but such a strong
central vitality had God planted in that noble organism, that, with
the returning breeze of freedom, and the spread of intelligence since
the great year 1789, the inward power of healthy life began again to
act powerfully, and the Turkish and Venetian disfigurement dropt off
speedily like a mere skin-disease as it was; and smooth Greek sounded
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
glibly again, not only in the pulpit, which was the strong refuge of
its prolonged vitality, but in the forum and from the throne. Those
who doubt what I say in this matter, had best go to Athens and see;
meanwhile, for the sake of those to whom the subject may be altogether
new,—and from the general pedantic narrowness of our academical
Greek I fear there may be many such—I shall set down a passage from
Perrhæbus, and another from a common Greek newspaper, from which the
fact will be abundantly evident that the language of Homer is not
dead, but lives, and that in a state of purity, to which, considering
the extraordinary duration of its literary existence—2500 years at
least,—there is no parallel perhaps on the face of the globe, in
Europe certainly not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
These are as fair specimens of the current dialect of Greece as I
can produce. For it is manifest that while it would be quite easy on
the one hand to select a specimen of the living dialect written by
mere men of learning, (as from the works of <span class="smcap">Œconomus</span>,)
which should make a much nearer approach to the idiom of Xenophon, it would
be equally open on the other to produce a brigand’s song from the
mountains of Acarnania containing a great deal more of the elements
of what the admirers of unmixed Atticism would be entitled to call
corruption. But it is evident that a specimen of the first kind would
be no more a fair specimen of the average Greek now spoken, than the
polished style of George Buchanan was of the average Latin current
in his day; and a brigand’s song were just as fair a specimen of the
Greek spoken by people of education in modern Athens, as a ballad in
the Cumberland or the Craven dialect is of the English of Macaulay’s
History, or Wordsworth’s White Doe. With this remark, by way of
explanation, let any person who can read common classical Greek without
a dictionary, tell me with what face it can be asserted that the above
is a specimen of a new language, in the same sense that Italian is a
different language from Latin, and Dutch from German. I find nothing in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
the extracts given, but such slight variations in verbal form, and
in the use of one or two prepositions and pronouns, as the reader of
Xenophon will find in far greater abundance when he turns to Homer. The
principal syntactic difference observable is the use of νὰ (for ἵνα),
with the subjunctive mood, instead of the infinitive, which the modern
Greeks have allowed to drop; but this is a usage, borrowed from the
Latin I have often thought, of which very frequent examples occur in
the New Testament; and besides, a mere new fashion in the syntactical
form of a sentence was never dreamt of by any sane grammarian, as
the sufficient sign of a new language. In English, for instance, we
say, <i>I beg you will accept this</i>, and, <i>I beg you to accept
this</i>. Now suppose one of these forms of expression to become
obsolete, by a change which mere fashion may effect any day, and the
other to become all dominant, could, I ask, any such change as this, or
a whole score of such changes, be said to corrupt the English language
in such a degree as to constitute a new tongue? Much less could the
introduction of a few new words, formed according to the analogy of
the language, be said to achieve such a transformation, though an
academic purist might indeed refuse to put such words as ἡλιοτυπία
(photography), and ἀτμοπλoῖov (a steam-boat), into his lexicon. As
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
little could a philosophical classical scholar be offended by the
loss of the optative mood, (used in the New Testament so sparingly,)
and the substitution for it of the auxiliary verb θέλω, which, though
it is of comparatively rare occurrence, is just as much according to
the genius of the Greek language, as the frequent use of the other
auxiliary verb <i>to be</i>, both in classical Greek and Latin. Instead
of fastening upon such insignificant peculiarities, a catholic-minded
scholar will rather be astonished to find that <i>in three columns
of a Greek newspaper of the year 1852, there do not certainly occur
three words that are not pure native Greek</i>. In fact the language,
so far from being corrupt, as its ignorant detractors assert, is the
most uncorrupt language in Europe, perhaps in the world, at the present
moment. The Germans boast of their linguistic purity, and sing songs
to Hermann who sent the legions of Varus with their lingo so bravely
out of the Westphalian swamps; but let any man compare a column of a
German newspaper with a column from the <b>ΑΘΗΝΑ</b>, or any other
ἐφημερίς issued within the girth of King Otho’s dominions, and he will
understand that while the Greek language even now is as a perfectly
pure vestment, the German in its familiar use is defaced by the
ingrained blots of many ages, which no philologic sponge of Adelung or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
Jacob Grimm will ever prevail to wash out. There are reasons for this
remarkable phenomenon in the history of language, which to a thoughtful
student of the history of the Greek people will readily suggest
themselves. I content myself with stating the fact.</p>

<p>These things being so, the natural observation that will occur to
every one, as bearing on our present inquiry, is, that as the Greek is
manifestly a living language, and never was dead, but only suffering
for a season under a cutaneous disease now thrown off, those who speak
that language are entitled to a decisive voice in the question how
their language is to be pronounced, <i>and this on the mere ground
that they are alive and speak it</i>; and to their decision we must
bow on the sole ground of living authority and possessory right. For
every living language exercises this despotic authority over those who
learn it; and it is not in the nature of things that one should escape
from such a sovereignty. No doubt there may be certain exceptions to
which, for certain special philological purposes, this general rule
of obedience is liable; but the rule remains. Such an exception, for
instance, in the literature of our existing English language, is the
peculiar accentuation of many words that occur in Shakspeare, and even
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
in Milton, different from that now used, whereby their rhythm limps to
our ear in the places where such words occur. Such exceptions, also,
are the dissyllabic words in Chaucer, that are now shortened into
monosyllables, and yet must be read as dissyllables by all those who
will enjoy the original harmony of the poet’s rhythm. In Greek, as I
have already observed, the whole quantitative value of the language has
had its poles inverted; in which practice we cannot possibly follow the
living users of the tongue, because we learn the language not to speak
with them, as a main object, (though this also has its uses seldom
thought of by schoolmasters,<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>)
but to read the works of their ancient poets, the rhythmical value of
whose works their living speech disowns. This is a sweeping exception
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
to that dominancy of usage which Horace recognises as supreme
in language; but philological necessity compels; and the modern
Athenians must even submit in such points to receive laws from learned
foreigners. But with all this large exceptive liberty, we dare
not disown the rule. We must follow the authority of their living
dictation, so far as the object we have in view allows; and if we
are philosophical students of the language, our object never can be
resolutely to ignore all knowledge of the elocutional genius and habits
of the living people who speak it. It must be borne in mind also,
with how much greater ease a living language can be acquired than a
dead one; so that were it only for the sake of the speedy mastery of
the ancient dialect, a thorough practical familiarity with the spoken
tongue ought first to be cultivated. The present practice, indeed,
of teaching Greek in our schools and colleges, altogether as a dead
language, can be regarded only as a great scholastic mistake; and it
may be confidently affirmed by any person who has reflected on the
method of nature in teaching languages, that more Greek will be learned
by three months’ well-directed study at Athens, where it is spoken,
than by three years’ devotion to the language under the influence of
our common scholastic and academic appliances in this country.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span></p>

<p>I am now led, in the last place, to observe, that whatever may be
thought of Itacism and of accents, as the dominant norm for the
teaching of Greek in this country, one thing is plain, that no scholar
of large and catholic views can, after what has been said and proved
in this paper, content himself with teaching Greek according to the
present arbitrary and anti-classical fashion <i>only</i>. The living
dialect also must be taught with all its peculiarities, not only
because the heroic exploits of a modern Admiral Miaulis are as well
worthy of the attention of a Hellenic student as those of an ancient
Phormion; but for strictly philological uses also, and that of more
kinds than one. The transcribers of the MSS., for one thing, in the
Middle Ages, all wrote with their ear under the habitual influence of
the pronunciation which now prevails; and were accordingly constantly
liable to make mistakes that reveal themselves at once to those who are
acquainted with that pronunciation, but will only slowly be gathered by
those whose ears have not been trained in the same way. But what is of
more consequence for Hellenic philologers to note accurately is, that
the spoken dialect of the Greek tongue, though modern in name and form,
is nowise altogether modern in substance: but like the conglomerate
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
strata of the geologists, contains imbedded very valuable fragments
of the oldest language of the country. Of this it were easy to adduce
proofs from so common a book as Passow’s Greek-German Dictionary, where
occasional reference is made to the modern dialect in illustration of
the ancient; from which source, I presume, with much else that is of
first-rate excellence in lexicography, such references have passed into
the English work of Liddell and Scott. But on this head I shall content
myself with simply directing the student’s attention to the fact, and
appending below the testimony of Professor Ross of Halle—a man who has

I have now finished all that I had to say on this subject, which has
proved perhaps more fertile of speculative suggestion and of practical
direction than the title at first promised. What I have said will at
least serve the purpose for which it was immediately intended, that
of justifying my conduct should I find it expedient to introduce
any decided innovations in the practice of teaching Greek in our
metropolitan University. And if it should further have the effect
of inducing any thoughtful teacher to inquire into a curious branch
of philology which he may have hitherto overlooked, and to question
the soundness of the established routine of classical inculcation in
some points, whatever disagreeable labour I may have gone through in
clearing the learned rubbish from so perplexed a path will not have
been without its reward. Any sympathizing reader who may communicate
with me, wishing that I should explain, reconsider, or modify any
statement here made, will find me, I hope, as willing to listen as to
speak, and not more zealous for victory than for truth.</p>

What he says about the tongue performing no part in the formation

This limitation must be carefully borne in mind; for after Athens
ceased to be a capital, being overwhelmed by Alexandria, it still
remained a sort of literary metropolis, giving, or affecting to give,
the law in matters of taste, long after its authority had ceased

In some English schools a small concession has been made to common
sense, and to sound principles of teaching, by confining the long
slender sound of <i>a</i> to the long α, while the short α is
pronounced like the short <i>a</i> in <i>bat</i>. Now, as changes
are not easily made in England, especially among schoolmasters, who
are a stiff-necked generation everywhere, it would have been worth
while when they were moving, to kick the barbarous English
<span class="allsmcap">a</span> out of the scholastic world altogether.
But their conservatism was too strong for this; besides, the ears of many
were so gross that they would not have distinguished, or would have
sworn that they could not distinguish, a long <i>a</i> from a short
one, without giving the former the sound of an entirely distinct vowel!
There is no limit to the nonsense that men will talk in defence of an
inveterate absurdity.</p>

blindly prejudice many sometimes speak: “Strong national partiality

by the French critics, that the Greek υ was a sound so unpleasant,
produced by a position of the lips so ungraceful as the French
<span class="allsmcap">u</span>.”—<i>History</i>, book ii. sec. iii.,

With regard to this sort of evidence arising from wrong spelt words,
it is manifest that a single example proves nothing. When Aunt Chloe,
for instance, in the American novel, says, “I’m <i>clar</i> on’t,” this
is no proof that the Americans pronounce the <i>ea</i> in <i>clear</i>
like <i>a</i>; the only conclusion is, that certain vulgar people in
America pronounce it so, and a word with a different vocalization must
be written in order to express their peculiar method of utterance.
But when mistakes of this kind occur extensively, and in quarters
where there is no reason to suspect anything particularly vulgar, they
authorize a conclusion as general as the fact, especially where no
evidence exists pointing in a different direction.</p>

On revisal it strikes me I have given the enemies of Itacism an
unfair advantage by not stating, that, while in any other language
the attenuation of so many different sounds into one, might have
proved a very grievous evil, there is such a richness of the full
sound of α (which the English have effaced) and ω in Greek, that the
blemish rarely offends. I have to mention also, that, while a certain
prominence even of this slender sound seems necessary to the phonetic
character of Greek, as distinguished from Latin, I have no objection,
in reading Homer and the elder poets, (were it only for the sake of the
often quoted <big>πολυφλοίσβοιο θαλάσσης</big>!) to pronounce οι, as
<i>boy</i> in English, and η, as we do it in Scotland; just as in reading
Chaucer we may be forced to adopt some of the peculiarities of the pronunciation
of his day. But in the common use of the prose language, I think it
safer to stick by the tradition of so many centuries, than to venture
on patches of classical restoration, where it is impossible to revive
a consistent whole. I may say also, that if υ be pronounced uniformly
like the French <i>u</i>, the itacism will be diminished by one letter,
while the difference between that and the modern Greek pronunciation
is so slight, that a Scotchman so speaking in Athens will be generally
understood, whereas our broad Scotch <i>u</i> (<i>oo</i>) besides being
entirely without classical authority, recedes so far from the actual
pronunciation of the Greeks, as to be a serious bar in the way of
intelligibility.</p>

There is also a greater <i>emphasis</i> or <i>stress</i> given to
the accented syllable, as is manifest from the pronunciation of the
modern Greeks, and from the striking fact that in the modern dialect,
the unaccented syllable has sometimes been dropt, while the accented
constitutes the whole modern word, as <big>δὲν</big> for <big>οὐδὲν,

“Any person for <i>Mánchéster</i>” with a distinct and well-marked

pronounced ἄνθρωπος, accenting the first syllable, but dwelling on the

Every practical teacher ought to know how much more easily the doctrine

<a id="Footnote_39" href="#FNanchor_39" class="label">[39]</a> “Our
composition of classical verses is almost entirely mechanical. When
a boy composes such a verse as <i>Insignemque canas Neptunum vertice
cano</i>, how is he guided to the proper collocation of the words? Not
by his ear, certainly, for that would be struck precisely in the same
manner if he wrote it <i>Insignemque cano Neptunum vertice canas</i>;
no, he learns from books that the first of <i>cano</i> (I sing) is
short, and the first of <i>canus</i> (hoary) is long. Having so used
them, their respective quantity is stored up as a fact in his memory,
and by degrees he remembers them so well, that when he sees either
of them used in a wrong place, he thinks it offends his ear, while
in truth it only offends his understanding. But I apprehend a Roman
boy’s process of composition would be quite different. Having been
used from his cradle to hear the first syllable of <i>canus</i> take
up about twice as much time as that of <i>cano</i>, such a verse as
<i>Insignemque cano Neptunum vertice canas</i>, would really hurt his
ear, because in the second foot the thesis would be complete before the
syllable was expressed, and he would have a time or σημεῖον too much;
and in the sixth he could not fill up the time of the arsis without
giving to the syllable a drawling sound which would be both unusual and
offensive.”—<span class="smcap">Pennington</span>, p. 249. So long as
such an absurd system of writing verses, whether Latin or Greek—from
the understanding and not from the ear—is practised, the boys who
refuse to have anything to do with prosody shew a great deal more sense

Perhaps some classical young gentleman at Oxford or Cambridge may be
moved by the consideration brought forward in the following passage:—“I
was much delighted with this really Grecian ball, at which I was
the only foreigner. The Grecian fair I have ever found peculiarly
agreeable in society. They are not in the smallest degree tainted with
the artificial refinements and affectations of more civilised life,
while they have all its graces and fascinations; and I cannot help
thinking that as some one thought it worth while to learn ancient Greek
at the age of seventy, for the sole purpose of reading the Iliad, so
it is well worthy the pains of learning modern Greek at <i>any</i>
age, for the pleasure of conversing, in her own tongue, with a young
and cultivated Greek beauty.”—<i>Wanderings in Greece</i>, by

writes to Professor <span class="smcap">Bergh</span> of Marburg, as
follows:—“My views are founded chiefly on the observation of the
dialect used by the common people of Greece, among whom and with
whom I lived so long. This dialect, indeed, now spoken by the Greek
shepherds and sailors, and which, of course, is not to be learnt from
books, but from actual intercourse with the people, the majority of
philologists are apt to hold cheap, but it has been to me a mine of
rich instruction, and I have no hesitation in saying that, at all
events, in reference to the non-Attic dialects of the Greek tongue, to
Latin, Oscan, and even Etruscan, more may be got from this source than
from the many bulky commentaries of the grammarians of the Middle Ages.

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use

easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
